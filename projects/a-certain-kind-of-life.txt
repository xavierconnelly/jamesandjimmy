          An exhibition that explores the broadened contemporary asceticism within its spatial lineage, “<a href="https://www.trienaldelisboa.com/news/d/news_0769affd-2ad8-11e9-93f6-ac1f6b817f78">A Certain Kind of Life</a>” exposes the typology of the charterhouse as an architecture of absolute rationality. Taking place at the <i>Cartuxa de Laveiras</i> as parts of the <a href="https://www.trienaldelisboa.com/programme/triennali/2019"> 2019 Lisbon Triennale </a>, interventions across the site include the installation of a cell—the paradigmatic evocation of asceticism; research material detailing the typological repetition and composition of several monasteries; projects for contemporary living; and a series of talks discussing ritual as rationalism and its resultant architectural form.
