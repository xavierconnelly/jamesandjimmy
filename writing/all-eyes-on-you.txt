        You close the door to the children’s bedroom behind you and lock it quietly. The door to the living room must be locked as well, and the door to your bedroom. Finally, you lock the glazed doors to outside. Only then are you alone. You put the toilet seat cover down. Extending your tired limbs, you watch the sun from the skylight hit your glass of wine on the vanity in the center of the room. Through the glazed doors you can see the trees above the embankment. The view is the one point of certainty in the room, an image you can distinguish from the monolithic timber lining the floor, ceiling, and walls. The whole room is a frame for the exterior view. You light a cigarette.

      <p>
        You need this cigarette like this house needs locks. Solitude is not something that comes easily in this conglomeration of ten identically sized rooms. Room after room, someone is always watching you or barging in. Even in your bedroom, external glazed doors remove any possibility of privacy—the blinds you ordered six months after the house was finished haven’t arrived yet. Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen, a study, a dining room, and two living rooms, and it is still hard to find a moment to yourself. You all have your own rooms, but none of you have your own space. You can still hear your children screaming on the other side of the wall. They’re probably in one of the living rooms along the house’s west wing.

        The house has a distorting ascetic opulence. Based on a four by four meter module, the rooms level all domestic activities to the same degree of importance. Sitting on the toilet, hidden behind the vanity in your oversized bathroom, you escape. Yet even here you’re not safe. A sure way to arouse suspicion is to lock the doors for more than five minutes. The plan offers complete openness and freedom of behavior, yet the thresholds between rooms can potentially shut the plan down. More than signifying the desire to be undisturbed, a locked door marks a failure, an exhaustion of interaction. You hear your son Andy calling for you in the southern living room. You close your eyes.

      <p>
        You missed the part about how the bathrooms were to function when you moved in. Two weeks and some embarrassing interruptions later had you putting locks on all four doors. Now all four have to be turned before you can sit down. Thirty seconds of your five minutes of peace is spent locking and unlocking doors, first clockwise around the vanity to lock, and then counter-clockwise to unlock again. The children’s room is always locked first and unlocked last. There are twenty-three timber-clad hinged doors and four large timber-framed openings in this house. Collectively, they undermine each room’s autonomy. Rooms are like sieves, open and porous, and every door is your back door for escape.

        Michael will be removing the marshmallow stains on the walls by now. Those beautiful, golden, timber walls. You stare at the ones around you: the pine boards are relentlessly horizontal. Each room has the same walls, the same floor, the same ceiling, the same doors, the same windows. A monomania of sameness. Only wooden knots and other defects add distinction to the self-similar surfaces. Doors, skylight linings, and cabinetry are all deftly contrasted—clad vertically. The house is a replication of archetypal elements: rooms, frames, doors, skylights. You are never exactly sure where you are.

        Your eyes turn to the smooth, white sink in the middle of the room. Rooms are differentiated by objects in this house: the bathrooms by white fixtures, the kitchen by a glossy sink and metal range hood, living rooms by stark-black wood heaters, and the dining room by an oversized table. You never understood the organizational power of domestic objects until now. Objects lend programmatic specificity. Some are centrally placed, necessitating cyclical movement around them, and drawing the family inwards at moments of repose. Others are pushed off to the edges, allowing movement to pass straight through the room, and sending the family outwards to sit or lie down. Whether central or peripheral, the objects seem to orient you toward an opening or exterior view. You turn the cigarette around into the ashtray, extinguishing it.

        Daisy’s clothes and hiking shoes sit in a corner of the bathroom. You and Michael never imagined how hard it would be to maintain order in this house. Being enveloped by timber lining boards is charming, of course, but you do need some storage. You know it would be improper to interrupt the monolithic image with a chest of drawers from downtown Providencia; an outdoor storage shed will arrive next week. The piles of equipment will have to wait to be cleared away. 
      </p> 
          
      <p>
        “MUM!” Oh no, not again. Is that Daisy in her room? You sit up straight with your back against the cistern. You glimpse the embankment through the window again. “MUM, WHERE ARE YOU?” You move clockwise around the room, rapidly unlocking the door to the living room, the door to your bedroom, and the door to outside. Finally, you unlock the door to the children’s bedroom, hoping Daisy doesn’t hear you. She always finds distractions, and the house’s permeable plan always obliges. You wait, surrounded by closed doors that feel open, ready to be burst through at any moment. The doors are more like jack-in-the-boxes than barriers. Your phone begins to vibrate: “mum where r u?” This is your new norm of solitude, your new house and new forms of communication conspiring to produce a familial life as much about connection as separation. You swing open the external doors and slip outside, pressing yourself against the wall. 
      </p>
          
      <p>
        Inside, as the children look from room to room, you’re bound to be found by deductive reasoning. Outside, as the external doors frame distinct views, you can sit along the façade between each opening almost incognito: an activity that is especially pleasant in the sun. The elevation of house is simple. Five glazed double doors are symmetrically positioned along the facade. Thin black trim outlines each door. The roof is low and flat, and cantilevers out. Its striped timber underside folds ninety degrees to become the elevation. The dyed, rough pine boards are the same color as the press-metal roof. Matching timber and metal—another example of the architects’ fixation? Yet, from the top of the hill, a yellow roof remains a pleasant sight.  You’ll have to leave your wine glass on the vanity—no time to go back for it now.

        You head south under the awning, peering into rooms as you pass by. You check the children’s bedroom: no children. You walk past the other bathroom: not there either. The final bedroom: no one. The house repeats. Room after room after room after room after room. From the outside you understand this is a house with no center. An ice cube tray for people. Two rows of five identical rooms. You turn west and peer through the next set of doors. You see Daisy and Andy holding their marshmallow sticks in the living room. Michael scrubs the walls. It’s time to reemerge. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone’s too engrossed in the fire and stains to immediately notice you. You knock on the glass. Michael, Daisy, and Andy look up. They’re smiling—not alarmed. You’ve disturbed them, but everyone expects to be disturbed now. You’ve all adapted to this house, even if you are still trying to find your equilibrium within it. Privacy is sacred, yet privacy is hard to find without your own space. There are plenty of rooms, but no space. You enter the room. All eyes are on you.
