            James and Jimmy is an architecture studio and dissemination unit whose practice delves into the breadth of architectural distribution and production. The studio believes that architecture is not merely material, concentrating on platforms in which architecture as a cultural production can take shape. In this way, projects are varied, mediums are numerous and characters are fluid, but all is grounded in architectural creation. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Clients and affiliates of the studio include MPavilion, Open House Melbourne, ACMI, Tokyo Tina, Wrightwood 659, University of Illinois at Chicago, and the Lisbon Triennale, among others.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The studio’s work has been published in MAS Context, Pidgin, Flat Out, Assemble Papers and many others.
